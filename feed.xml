At its core, the circular form suggests a horizon—a rising or setting sun—drawing the eye inward and evoking a sense of place and atmosphere. The blue palette nods to the “blue planet,” grounding our work in environmental awareness and global context.</p>

<p>The abstract form can also be read as a tree in plan view, merging natural systems with design thinking. A surrounding orbital band hints at movement and unity—representing the interconnectedness of landscape, ecology, and people.</p>

<p>In another light, the logo is seen as a creative “big bang”—a burst of energy symbolizing growth, imagination, and the powerful momentum behind every landscape we shape.</p>]]></content><author><name>derrick-eberle</name></author><category term="update" /><category term="company" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to unveil our new logo capturing the spirit and vision of our practice.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/baumwelt-staging/assets/images/posts/logo-stacked-2tone.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="/baumwelt-staging/assets/images/posts/logo-stacked-2tone.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Penmet Minigolf</title><link href="/baumwelt-staging/news/penmet-minigolf/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Penmet Minigolf" /><published>2025-05-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-05-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>/baumwelt-staging/news/penmet-minigolf</id><content type="html" xml:base="/baumwelt-staging/news/penmet-minigolf/"><![CDATA[<p>We’re thrilled to share a sneak peek of the first shipment of themed features arriving for the new minigolf course at PenMet Parks headquarters.

<p>Loaded up and ready for installation, the truck carries an exciting cast of characters and landmarks: two orcas, snow-capped mountains, a lighthouse, a ferry, a steam donkey, seals, salmon, and yes—even Bigfoot.</p>
